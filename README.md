# üìö DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my daily Data Structures & Algorithms practice solutions, focusing on Java and LeetCode problems.  
---

‚úÖ **Goals:**
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Prepare for product-based and service-based companies
- Consistent daily coding

---

I have already solved a few problems on Leetcode on arrays and other basic concepts on my machine which will be added to this repository shortly.

---

## ‚úÖ Example Problem Format

Each problem file includes:
- Problem title and LeetCode link
- Time and space complexity
- Java solution with main method (for testing) and the approaches used to solve the problem.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

- Clone this repository:
  `git clone https://github.com/Vaishnavi020404/DSA-Practice.git`
- Open in your IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)
- Compile and run Java files individually.

## ‚≠ê Contributions

This repo is mainly for my personal practice.
Feedback and suggestions are welcome!

Abbreviations used to avoid writing long names for files:
1.Leetcode 33 and 81:
SIRSA-SearchingInRotatedSortingArray
SIRSAD-SearchingInRotatedSortingArrayWithDuplicates 

üîπ Problem 33 ‚Äî LeetCode Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Input: Distinct integers only

Return Type: int ‚Äî index of target, or -1 if not found

No duplicates

Binary Search + Pivot logic

üîπProblem 81 ‚Äî LeetCode Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
Input: Integers (can contain duplicates)

Return Type: boolean ‚Äî true if found, false if not

Duplicates allowed

Binary Search + Duplicates Handling

NOTES given by My dear Chatgpt for a sundar code:(I have not implemented the techniques of this type of code through out ,but I started doing it consistently after the creation of Arrays folder.)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Naming Conventions
| Type           | Style                       | Example                                |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Class          | PascalCase                  | `ContainsDuplicates`, `LinkedListNode` |
| Method         | camelCase                   | `containsDuplicatesUsingHashSet()`     |
| Boolean Method | camelCase + is/has/contains | `hasDuplicate()`, `isSorted()`         |
| Variable       | camelCase, meaningful       | `nums`, `count`, `set`, `index`        |
| Constant       | ALL\_CAPS                   | `MAX_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`          |


Rule: names should reflect purpose clearly.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Code Formatting

Indent 4 spaces per level.

Leave blank lines between logical sections (input, processing, output).

Keep line length ‚â§ 100 chars if possible.

Group related code together.

Example:

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); // Input section

int n = sc.nextInt();
int[] nums = new int[n];

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    nums[i] = sc.nextInt();
}

3Ô∏è‚É£ Commenting

Header comments: Problem, link, date, approach, complexity.

Section comments: Input / Processing / Output.

Method comments: Purpose, approach, complexity.

Inline comments: Only for non-obvious steps.

Example:

// Approach 1: Using HashSet to track seen numbers
// Returns true if any duplicate exists
static boolean containsDuplicatesUsingHashSet(int[] nums) {
    HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (set.contains(num)) return true; // Duplicate found
        set.add(num);
    }
    return false; // No duplicates
}

4Ô∏è‚É£ Structure

Header comment

Imports

Class declaration

Main method

Input section

Processing section

Output section

Helper methods (approaches, utils)

5Ô∏è‚É£ Optional Enhancements

Close resources (like Scanner).

Consistent naming (don‚Äôt switch num ‚Üí val).

Use descriptive boolean names: isDuplicateFound instead of res.
